# Declare these variables: name, age, temp, skies.
# Set the value for them as the ordinal cli arguments respectively.

# you are?"

# under 21, print "My ... you are a young whippersnapper, aren't you?"
# If the age is under 31 print "You still have your life ahead of you, young
# man". If the age is under 61 print "Don't worry. You're still younger

# Write an if/else if/else structure to determine which temp string is
# assigned based on temperature like so:
# temp under 41: cold
# temp under 66: pleasant
# temp under 81: warm
# else? hot










# Clean skies variable to be set to lower case, have all whitespace
# stripped from both right and left.

# to go to the beach."



# If the skies are cloudy and temp_str is cold or pleasant, print "Could be
# better but doesn't sound too bad."




# If the skies are cloudy and temp_str is warm, print "Sounds a little muggy."



# If the skies are cloudy and temp_str is hot, print "Sounds very
# uncomfortable."



# If the skies are rainy and temp_str is cold, print "Sounds like a bad day."



# If the skies are rainy and temp_str is pleasant or warm, print "You guys
