Use Bash for the most simple things but no more active learning with it.
Anything you would want to use Bash for that is beyond just simple command line things, use Perl.

Speed?

C       .002 .002
Bash    .007 .014
Perl    .013 .010
PHP     .037 .042
Ruby    .065 .063
JS      .089 .090
Java    .124 .128
Python  .198 .195

Goals for each of the languages:

C++ know enough to be competent with it. Don't expect to write much with it though.

Java master as much of it as possible.

Python master as much of it as possible. Less Django for more ROR.

PHP master regular web design. Don't worry about frameworks.

JS master standard client-side, jQuery, nodejs as a scripting language.

Ruby get to know the language as well as Python. Master ROR.

Perl try to know this almost as well as Python.

Bash know enough to get simple and intermediate and cli things done.
